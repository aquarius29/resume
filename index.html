	<div class="text editable" id="objective" align="justify">Make the world a better place. 
My aim is to work on projects/solutions/products which directly benefit people. I receive great satisfaction from solving practical tasks where the solution is somehow observable. Automating tasks and making my life easier with the help of technology - it is something I invest a part of my free time into.

		<span>
			Project converts youtube videos to mp3 audio file, stores the file on my server and adds the link to this mp3 file to my RSS feed. I then listen to this audio file as podcast on my phone.
		</span>

		<span id="line1">Word catcher<span class="labs"><a href="https://gitlab.com/aquarius29/word_catcher" class="fa fa-gitlab" aria-hidden="true" target="_blank"></a></span> <span class="mark">Python</span> <span class="mark">Fun</span></span>
		<span>
			Quick implementation of a fun idea to help my friend learn English. The script will search a given word or phrase in the subtitles of a movie (present on the hard drive) and will cut out all the scenes where given word is spoken and compile new clip out of these scenes.
			The goal was to hear the pronounciation of the word and different use-cases for it.
		</span>

		<span id="line1">Swedish Migration Office - case check <span class="mark">PHP</span></span>
		<span>
			It takes so long for migration office to take a decision on your work permit case that I get tired of checking the status, so this script is checking the status of my application 2 times a day by scraping the website and looking for the right patterns. Then it notifies me by email if the decision is taken.
		</span>

		<span id="line1">Workout audio guide generator <span class="mark">Python</span> <span class="mark">Amazon API</span><span class="mark">Standalone script</span></span>
		<span>
			Takes the list of HIIT exercises and generates audio file out of them: combines mp3 files of background music and merges that background with the exercise name read out by the voice of Amazon's Polly. As result you get an audio file which is follow along workout. Motivation: I could never remember 10 exercises and their order during high intensity workout, so I had to constantly look at the paper which kind of sucked.

		<span>
			To help my wife save time for generating participation certificates in a workshop, this script takes the certificate's template and a list of the participants and generates one pdf document with participant's name on the certificate. This same script also generated name tags for participants which also had different colours based on the role of participant.

		<span>
			Herz (car rent company) has a site "freerider" where one can book a car for free. This car should be driven from location A to location B directly. It was a great and free way to travel for us when we were students. The problem was the booking process and the popular destinations were gone quickly (like Got to Sto). The script scrapes the site looking for good destinations, allows to book directly with herz. It also shows the route and how long it will take to drive to destination

		<span id="line1">Memrise course<span class="mark">Node.js</span> <span class="mark">Scraping</span><span class="mark">Automation</span></span>
		<span>
			<a href='https://www.memrise.com//'>Memrise</a> is a platform which helps people to memorize things, like foreign words and many more. A friend of mine was planning to move to Sweden for work so I decided to help him with language. Memrise allows users to create courses and load different words there with translations. I created a course with 1000 most used words in Swedish language based on the Arbetsformedlingen website. I scanned all the job postings on the site and collected all the words and sorted them by usage. Then I used acapela-group website to generate mp3 file with pronounciation of the word and google translate to get the translation of the words. Fun!

		<span>
			In 2017 I join the running challenge where I had to run 2017 km during they year 2017. I created a laravel project (just to get to know it a bit) which took the data from strava.com about my current year activities, combined the distances I ran so far and gave me statistics how far behind the goal I am and how much I should run every day if I want to complete the challenge. Spoiler: I didn't run 2017km that year :/
